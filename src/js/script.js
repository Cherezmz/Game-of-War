// * Define a Card class with the following properties:
//*
//* - suit(hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds)
// * - rank(Ace, 2, 3, 4, ..Jack, King, Queen)
//* - score(1, 2, 3, 4, ... 11, 12, 13)
//*
//* Define a Deck class with the following properties and methods:
//*
//* - length(the number of cards - should start at 52)
// * - cards(an array of cards in the deck)
//* - draw: return a random card from the cards array
//    *
//* When you create an instance of your Deck class (i.e.in your constructor),
//* fill in the cards array with 52 instances of your Card class.You can do
//* this with a nested for loop - first loop through an array of all possible
// * suits, then loop through an array of all possible ranks.Inside your inner
//   * loop, create an instance of your Card class and push it into the Deck's cards
//     * array.

//create two empty arrays where to put cards after each round
//let deckFirstPlayBegins = []
//let deckSecondPlayBegins = []

//create logic how to compare the cards. 
//may use do-while, where "while" is either deckFirstPlayBegins or deckSecondPlayBegins
//is less than 52 (total number of cards)
// in "do" we should use if-else statements and compare value of each card
//inside if-else we should use loops to try all the deck
// for tie/war situation need additional arrey to keep cards and then
// move card to the deck of won player 

//do {
